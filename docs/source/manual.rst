Basic Ideas for User
--------------------

The judge uses a system of ``Contest`` s.
A ``Contest`` consists of a set of ``Problem`` s.

A user can be a ``Poster``, a ``Participant`` or neither for a ``Contest``.
For each ``Contest`` a user will hold one and only one position.

The user who creats a ``Contest`` becomes the ``Poster`` for the ``Contest``.
The ``Poster`` can add more ``Poster`` s, who would help in creating the problems.
These ``Poster`` s together write a set of ``Problem`` s for the ``Contest``.

The ``Poster`` can leave the ``Contest`` open for all users to particpate, in which case it is called a ``Public Contest``.
Or the ``Poster`` may specify a set of ``Participant`` s. In this case only these users can particpate in the ``Contest``. Such ``Contest`` s are also called ``Private Contest`` s.
Note that no ``Poster`` can ever participate in a contest.

If the ``Contest`` is ``Public`` every user is either a ``Poster`` or a ``Participant``.
If the ``Contest`` is ``Private``, a user can be either a ``Poster`` or a ``Participant`` or neither. All the users who are not specified as ``Participant`` by the ``Poster`` s belong to the category of neither. Such users cannot participate in that ``Contest``.

Consider as an example a course assignment. It can be posted as a ``Contest``.
Each individual question becomes a ``Problem``.
The Instructor and the TAs can be ``Poster`` s, while the registered students for that course would be ``Participant`` s.
No other user would be able to participate in that ``Contest``.
