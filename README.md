---
This is an implementation of an online judge that can be used for conducting programming contests as well as managing assignments in a university.

Apart from the facilities of usual programming contest portals, this portal provides facilities which are well suited for assignment submission.

These additional features include: Instructor (Problem poster) grades above judge scores, soft and hard deadlines for assignments including penalties, customizable compilation and test script, linter scores et cetera.

Currently, the judge supports 5 languages: C, C++, Python, Go and Haskell but this list can be extended easily.
